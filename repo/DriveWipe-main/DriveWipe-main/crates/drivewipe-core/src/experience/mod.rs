//! Two ways through the tool: one for people who know disks, one for people
//! who know what they want to happen to them.
//!
//! DriveWipe's method list is 27 entries deep and named after standards
//! documents. That is exactly right for someone sanitising a fleet against a
//! compliance requirement, and exactly wrong for someone who booted a USB stick
//! to erase a laptop before selling it. Basic mode answers the second person's
//! question — how thoroughly, and how long — and picks the standard for them.
//!
//! Nothing is hidden that changes what happens to the data: Basic mode maps
//! onto the same wipe methods, and always names the standard it selected so the
//! choice can be checked or repeated from the command line.
