//! DriveWipe Live Environment Capability Crate
//!
//! This crate provides enhanced hardware interaction capabilities specifically
//! designed for the DriveWipe Live boot environment. It bridges the gap between
//! standard userspace tools and low-level hardware control.
//!
//! ## Core Capabilities
//!
//! - **Kernel Integration**: Direct communication with the `drivewipe` Linux kernel module.
//! - **Hidden Areas**: Detection and removal of HPA (Host Protected Area) and DCO (Device Configuration Overlay).
//! - **Security Management**: ATA security state querying and one-click unfreezing via suspend/resume cycles.
//! - **Performance**: Support for zero-copy DMA I/O paths when the kernel module is loaded.
//!
//! ## Fallback Strategy
//!
//! All hardware commands attempt to use the custom kernel module for maximum control.
//! If the module is missing, they gracefully fall back to standard `SG_IO` or
//! vendor-specific IOCTLs available in standard Linux kernels.

// HPA, DCO, the kernel-module interface and the DMA I/O path live in
// `drivewipe-core` so that the wipe engine can clear hidden areas before it
// starts writing. They are re-exported here unchanged, so `drivewipe_live::hpa`
// and friends continue to resolve for live-environment callers.
