# DriveWipe — Implementation Plan (v1.2.0)

## Context

DriveWipe is a cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) secure data sanitization tool written in Rust. It implements military/corporate-grade drive wiping compliant with modern standards (NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2, IEEE 2883:2022) including software overwrite for HDDs, firmware-level commands for SSDs, and cryptographic erasure for self-encrypting drives.

The tool provides three interfaces: a CLI for scripting/config, a TUI for advanced interactive use, and a GUI (Phase 2, pure Rust via egui/iced) for simpler automated use. It supports parallel multi-drive wipe, full read-back verification, audit logging, and PDF/JSON report generation.

**Key decisions from user:**
- All platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Full erasure suite (software + firmware + crypto erase)
- Multi-step safety confirmation before any destructive operation
- Refuse to wipe boot drive (plan for bootable USB image later)
- Resume capability after interruption with auto-restart option
- Drive queue: pre-built batch mode + live queue (add drives during active wipe)
- Per-drive method assignment in batches (auto-suggest best method per drive type)
- Auto-generate JSON report after every wipe (PDF on request only)
- `--force` flag for scripted use with extra safeguards (requires explicit --device, --method, --yes-i-know-what-im-doing)
- Warn on SSDs with software overwrite (recommend firmware erase)
- Warn on USB-attached drives (firmware commands may fail)
- Full audit logging (per-second summaries during wipe)
- State/logs saved to `~/.local/share/drivewipe/sessions/`
- Standalone only (no network/fleet features, but extensible architecture)
- 100% AI-coded — no constraints on complexity

**Custom License:** Free for personal, hobby, and commercial use. Government or organizations in intelligence, forensics, and security-related fields are expected to support or contribute to development. Open contribution.

### Core Traits

**`WipeMethod`** — Defines a multi-pass erasure strategy:
- `name()`, `id()`, `description()`, `pass_count()`
- `pattern_for_pass(pass) -> Box<dyn PatternGenerator>`
- `includes_verification() -> bool`

**`PatternGenerator`** — Produces fill data:
- `fill(buf: &mut [u8])` — fills buffer with pattern bytes
- Implementations: `ZeroFill`, `OneFill`, `ConstantFill(u8)`, `RandomFill(AesCtrRng)`, `RepeatingPattern(Vec<u8>)`

**`RawDeviceIo`** — Direct disk I/O:
- `open(path)`, `write_at(offset, buf)`, `read_at(offset, buf)`, `capacity()`, `block_size()`, `sync()`, `close()`
- Platform implementations: Linux (O_DIRECT), macOS (F_NOCACHE), Windows (NO_BUFFERING)

**`DriveEnumerator`** — Drive detection:
- `enumerate() -> Vec<DriveInfo>`, `inspect(path) -> DriveInfo`
- `detect_hidden_areas(path) -> HiddenAreaInfo`, `ata_security_state(path)`

**`FirmwareWipe`** — Firmware-level erase:
- `is_supported(drive) -> bool`, `execute(path, progress_tx) -> Result`
- Implementations: `AtaSecureErase`, `NvmeFormatErase`, `NvmeSanitize`

**`WipeEngine`** — Orchestrator:
- `execute(session, progress_tx, cancel_token) -> WipeReport`
- Core loop: for each pass, fill 1 MiB aligned buffer with pattern, write to device, send progress events
- Checks cancel token between blocks, saves state for resume

**`ProgressEvent`** — Channel-based event system (crossbeam-channel):
- `SessionStarted`, `PassStarted`, `BlockWritten`, `PassCompleted`, `VerificationStarted/Progress/Completed`, `FirmwareEraseStarted/Progress/Completed`, `Error`, `Interrupted`, `Completed`
- All frontends (CLI, TUI, GUI) receive these same events

### Safety Features

1. **Boot drive detection** — Refuse to wipe the drive the OS is running from
2. **Multi-step confirmation** — Show drive serial/model/capacity, require typing device path or "YES I UNDERSTAND", 3-second countdown with abort
3. **SSD software wipe warning** — Detect SSD, warn that software overwrite is unreliable due to wear leveling, recommend firmware erase, allow override
4. **USB drive warning** — Detect USB-attached drives, warn that firmware commands may fail through USB bridges
5. **Frozen ATA security warning** — Detect frozen state, suggest suspend/resume to unfreeze
6. **HPA/DCO detection** — Check for hidden areas, warn that they won't be reached by software overwrite, recommend ATA Enhanced Erase
7. **Root/admin check** — Verify elevated privileges on startup, provide platform-specific instructions if not elevated
8. **Ctrl+C handling** — Graceful interruption via CancellationToken, save state for resume

### Queue System

- **Batch mode**: Select multiple drives, assign method per drive (or one method for all), start the batch. Runs sequentially or in parallel based on `--parallel` flag or TUI toggle.
- **Live queue**: While drives are actively wiping, user can add more drives to the queue from the TUI or CLI. New drives start when a parallel slot opens up (configurable max concurrent drives, default: number of physical drives detected).
- **Auto-suggest**: When a drive is added to the queue, auto-suggest the best wipe method based on drive type (firmware erase for SSDs, software overwrite for HDDs). User can override.
- **Per-drive method**: Each queued drive has its own method, verification flag, and report config. The TUI shows a per-row method dropdown.

### Force Mode (Scripted/Automated Use)

- `--force` flag skips interactive confirmation BUT requires:
  - Explicit `--device <path>` (no "pick from list")
  - Explicit `--method <id>` (no default)
  - Must also pass `--yes-i-know-what-im-doing` (long flag, hard to typo)
- Logs a `WARN` level message: "Running in force mode — all confirmation bypassed"
- All other safety checks still apply (boot drive refusal, privilege check, SSD warnings logged but not interactive)

### Resume System

- State file: `~/.local/share/drivewipe/sessions/<uuid>.state`
- Contains: session UUID, device path, device serial, method ID, current pass, bytes written, timestamp
- On startup with `--auto-resume`: scan for incomplete `.state` files, match by device serial (not path, which can change), offer to resume
- State saved every 10 seconds during active wipe
- Cleaned up on successful completion

### Audit Logging

- Log file: `~/.local/share/drivewipe/sessions/<uuid>.log`
- Per-second entries during active wipe: `[timestamp] pass=2/3 written=45.2GiB/500GiB throughput=312MiB/s`
- All events logged: start, each pass start/end, errors, verification result, completion
- Survives crashes — flush after each entry

### Report Generation

- **JSON**: Auto-generated after every wipe to `~/.local/share/drivewipe/sessions/<uuid>.report.json`. Always available as an audit trail with zero user effort.
- **v1.2.0** (Current) — Production Certification & Performance Overhaul
- **PDF**: "Data Sanitization Certificate" — generated on request via `drivewipe report --format pdf --input <json>` or `--report-pdf <path>` flag during wipe. Contains drive info, method, pass details table, verification result, timestamps, operator name, hostname, session UUID.
- CLI `drivewipe report` subcommand can also regenerate PDF from any saved JSON report after the fact.

```

### Verification Plan

1. **Unit tests**: All pattern generators, wipe method configurations, error types, config parsing, report serialization round-trips
2. **Integration tests**: Wipe a 10 MiB temp file with each method, verify contents match expected patterns, test cancellation mid-wipe, test parallel multi-file wipe, test resume from saved state
3. **CLI tests**: `assert_cmd` + `predicates` for all subcommands with `--dry-run` flag
4. **TUI tests**: `ratatui::backend::TestBackend` render snapshots, state machine transition tests
5. **Real device tests**: Gated behind `--features real-device-tests` + `DRIVEWIPE_TEST_DEVICE` env var, never in CI
6. **CI**: GitHub Actions matrix — `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]` x `[stable, nightly]` — build, test, clippy, fmt

### Platform Limitations (documented clearly)

- **macOS**: ATA passthrough is very limited. Firmware erase commands may require Linux boot media. NVMe access uses private IONVMeFamily API or falls back to `nvme-cli` if installed. Recommend Linux for firmware operations.
- **Windows**: Requires Administrator. ATA passthrough via `IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH`. NVMe via `IOCTL_STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND`.
- **Linux**: Best platform support across the board. Full ioctl access for ATA, NVMe, and TCG Opal (via `sed-opal` kernel driver).

## Phase 2: GUI (Future)

- Pure Rust GUI using egui or iced
- Simplified workflow: detect drives -> pick method -> confirm -> wipe -> report
- Same core library, different presentation layer
