# Changelog

All notable changes to DriveWipe will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.5] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **`drivewipe methods`** lists every registered method with its pass count, type and whether its standard mandates verification, in table, JSON or plain-id form. There was previously no way to discover the available method IDs from the tool itself. It needs no privileges.

### Changed
- All 27 methods are now exercised against a real block device in CI, not just the five that were checked by hand: the 19 software methods each wipe and verify a loop device, and the 8 firmware methods must refuse unsupported media cleanly rather than panicking or reporting a false success. `scripts/test-device.sh --all` enumerates them from the binary, so a newly added method is covered without editing the script.
- `drivewipe methods` and `drivewipe report` no longer print a privilege warning; neither touches a device.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- **Wiping a real block device failed with `EINVAL`; the engine had never worked outside the test mock.** A page-aligned write buffer was allocated and then copied into a plain `Vec<u8>` before being handed to the write, and both verifiers read into unaligned `Vec<u8>` the same way. `Vec<u8>` carries no alignment guarantee, and `O_DIRECT` rejects any I/O whose user buffer is not aligned to the device's logical block size, so the alignment was discarded one line before it mattered. The aligned buffers now move into the blocking task and back rather than being copied, which also removes a 4 MiB memcpy per iteration. Every release before this one — v1.x included — could not wipe a physical drive.
- The unit suite could not catch this: its mock implements `RawDeviceIo` over a `Vec` and never touches `O_DIRECT`. `scripts/test-device.sh` now wipes and verifies a real loop device, and runs in CI.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- **`curl | sh` installs failed at extraction.** `tar` applies `-C` before resolving the archive path, so the absolute path passed to `-f` was looked up relative to the new directory. Installing from an already-extracted archive was unaffected, which is why it was not caught earlier — that path never extracts anything. The download path is now covered by `scripts/test-install.sh`, which stands a local HTTP server in for GitHub Releases and checks install, checksum verification, tamper rejection, `--version` pinning and uninstall; it runs in CI on Linux and macOS.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-07-31

Major release focused on making the DoD and mil-spec wipe methods genuinely
complete and verifiable on Linux.

> `v2.0.0` and `v2.0.1` were tagged but never published — the release gate
> caught a flaky test and then a missing `rustfmt` component before any artifact
> was built, and release tags are immutable. `2.0.2` is the first published
> release of this work.

### Added
- **One binary instead of three** — `drivewipe` now contains the CLI, terminal UI and desktop UI, and chooses between them from how it is invoked: a bare call on a terminal opens the TUI, `--gui` opens the desktop window, and any subcommand runs the CLI. Piped or redirected invocations fall back to the CLI so scripts and cron jobs stay predictable. `drivewipe-tui` and `drivewipe-gui` continue to work as symlinks, dispatched on argv[0]. Server and live-image builds can drop the desktop interface with `--no-default-features --features pdf-report`.
- **One-command installer** — `install.sh` detects platform and architecture, downloads the matching release, verifies it against the published SHA-256 checksum before installing, sets up `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` without root), writes a desktop entry, and supports `--uninstall`, `--version` and `--prefix`. It is also shipped inside each release archive for offline installs.
- **Six new sanitization standards** — NIST SP 800-88 Clear (`nist-800-88-clear`) and Purge (`nist-800-88-purge`), AFSSI-5020 (`afssi-5020`), AR 380-19 (`ar-380-19`), NAVSO P-5239-26 (`navso-p-5239-26`), and VSITR (`vsitr`). The CLI and README previously claimed NIST SP 800-88 compliance while no such method existed; selecting it returned "Unknown wipe method".
- **Byte-for-byte verification of random passes** — random passes are now reproduced from their AES-256-CTR seed and compared against the full device surface. Previously a random pass could only be sampled: 16 blocks were read and checked for being non-zero, so a sector that silently failed to take the write passed unnoticed. Both DoD methods end on a random pass and were therefore the least-verified methods in the tool.
- **Per-pass verification** — `--verify-each-pass` (config: `verify_each_pass`) reads the whole surface back after every pass instead of only the last, producing per-pass evidence at roughly double the wall-clock time.
- **Pre-wipe HPA/DCO removal** — hidden areas are now cleared before the overwrite begins, and the recovered capacity is wiped. Previously HPA/DCO were only *detected*, and only in the TUI; a wipe of a drive with a Host Protected Area left the hidden sectors intact and still reported success. Controlled by `remove_hidden_areas` (default on); an area that cannot be removed is reported as a warning on the certificate.
- **TRIM/discard support** — `BLKDISCARD` is issued across the whole device after the overwrite passes for the SSD, NVMe and USB secure methods.
- **Offset-addressable patterns** — `PatternGenerator::fill_at` keys every pattern to its absolute device offset, making all passes reproducible and keeping a resumed pass byte-identical to an uninterrupted one.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `PatternGenerator` trait** — implementors must now provide `fill_at(&mut self, offset: u64, buf: &mut [u8])`. `fill(buf)` remains as a provided method delegating to `fill_at(0, buf)`.
- **BREAKING: `WipeMethod` trait** — gained `before_passes` and `after_passes` hooks (both defaulted) for hybrid methods that combine controller sanitize, overwrite, and TRIM.
- **BREAKING: HPA/DCO relocated** — `hpa`, `dco`, `kernel_module` and `dma_io` moved from `drivewipe-live` to `drivewipe-core` under `drivewipe_core::hidden`, so the wipe engine itself can clear hidden areas. `drivewipe-live` re-exports them, so existing `drivewipe_live::hpa::*` paths still resolve.
- **`includes_verification()` is now honoured** — it was previously dead code referenced only by tests, so disabling `auto_verify` silently skipped verification even for methods whose specification mandates it. Methods that require verification now always run it; `auto_verify` can add verification but no longer removes it.
- **Gutmann pattern table corrected** — passes 10-25 are now the full sixteen constants `0x00`-`0xFF` (only seven were present, and `0x77` was missing entirely), and passes 29-31 (`0x6D B6 DB`, `0xB6 DB 6D`, `0xDB 6D B6`) have been added; they were absent.
- **Repeating patterns are now continuous** — multi-byte sequences are phased to the device offset instead of restarting at every 4 MiB buffer boundary.
- **DriveWipe Secure methods now do what they describe** — the SATA SSD and NVMe methods documented TRIM and firmware sanitize steps they never performed, and those strings appear on signed certificates. Controller sanitize now runs before the overwrite passes (so the passes leave the final verifiable pattern), with TRIM after.
- **TUI live screens enabled by default** — the `live` feature is now a default feature, so HPA/DCO Manager, ATA Security, Kernel Module Status and the Live Dashboard are present in a stock build instead of being compiled out.
- **TUI settings are table-driven** — settings rendering and key handling now share one definition rather than duplicating hardcoded indices in three places, and the screen exposes Auto Verify, Verify Every Pass, Remove Hidden Areas and Default Method.

### Fixed
- Under per-pass verification the session verdict was taken from the last pass alone, so a failure on an earlier pass was discarded and the wipe still reported success.
- The GUI opened the device without sweeping HPA/DCO, so a wipe started from the desktop interface left hidden sectors intact even though the CLI and TUI covered them.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` in each release covered only one of the eight published artifacts, because the generating glob (`drivewipe-*`) did not match the desktop archives (`DriveWipe-*`) — while the release notes told users to verify their downloads against it.
- Release notes advertised a Live ISO that was silently omitted whenever the ISO build produced nothing; the ISO row now appears only when the file actually ships.
- Removed `quick-xml`, an unused dependency, and updated the lockfile, clearing all outstanding `cargo audit` vulnerabilities.
- Replaced the abandoned `genpdf` with `printpdf`, which drops `lopdf 0.26` and RUSTSEC-2026-0187 entirely — `cargo audit` is now clean with no suppressions — along with the unmaintained `rusttype`, `ttf-parser` and `stb_truetype` font crates.
- PDF certificates previously required a LiberationSans font file in one of four Linux paths and failed outright when none was found, so `--report-pdf` could not work on macOS or Windows. The certificate now uses the PDF base-14 fonts and needs no font files at all.
- PDF certificate metadata recorded the Unix epoch as its creation date; it now carries the wipe's completion time, the device, and the operator.
- Certificates now list per-pass verification results, warnings and errors, so an unremovable hidden area or a failed pass appears on the document itself.
- Verification no longer selects its strategy by substring-matching the pattern's display name.
- Resumed random passes are now consistent with the bytes already written.
- Remaining `collapsible_match` clippy lints in the TUI.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Partition-Aware Cloning** — Intelligent clone mode that parses GPT/MBR tables, copies partition table headers and each partition individually, skips unallocated space, and warns when partitions exceed target capacity.
- **Bandwidth Throttling** — Configurable rate limiting (`bandwidth_limit_bps`) for block, image, and partition-aware clone operations to prevent I/O saturation.
- **Forensic Hidden Area Detection** — Partition gap analysis that detects unallocated regions between partitions, scans for data remnants in gaps, identifies hidden/diagnostic MBR partitions, and reports HPA/DCO status.
- **GUI Forensic Execution** — Fully wired forensic scanning in the iced GUI with entropy stats, signature hits, sampling results, and hidden area findings displayed in real time.
- **GUI Clone Execution** — End-to-end clone workflow in the GUI with drive selection, start button, live progress bar, throughput display, and completion status.
