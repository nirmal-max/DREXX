# DriveWipe

**Cross-platform secure data sanitization and drive management tool** — NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 2 / IEEE 2883:2022 compliant.

DriveWipe provides military/corporate-grade drive wiping with software overwrite for HDDs, firmware-level commands for SSDs, and cryptographic erasure for self-encrypting drives. Beyond sanitization, it includes drive health monitoring, forensic analysis, drive cloning, partition management, and a bootable live environment for data sanitization labs — all in a single tool with CLI, TUI, and GUI interfaces.

---

## Why DriveWipe?

- **27 wipe methods** — software, firmware, and hybrid — covering every drive type
- **Live environment** — boot from USB or PXE network to wipe any drive, including the boot drive
- **Direct hardware access** — custom kernel module for ATA/NVMe passthrough, HPA/DCO manipulation, and DMA I/O
- **Full forensic toolkit** — entropy analysis, signature scanning, and formal chain-of-custody reports
- **Cross-platform** — native Linux, macOS, and Windows support with platform-specific optimizations
- **Three interfaces** — CLI for automation, TUI for interactive use, GUI for simplicity

---

## Features

### Secure Data Sanitization
- **15 software wipe methods** — Zero/One/Random fill, NIST SP 800-88 Clear & Purge, DoD 5220.22-M (3 & 7 pass), AFSSI-5020, AR 380-19, NAVSO P-5239-26, Gutmann (35 pass), HMG IS5 Baseline & Enhanced, RCMP TSSIT OPS-II, VSITR, plus custom user-defined methods
- **8 firmware wipe methods** — ATA Secure Erase (normal & enhanced), NVMe Format/Sanitize (5 modes), TCG Opal crypto erase
- **4 DriveWipe Secure methods** — Intelligent multi-phase sanitization tailored for HDD, SATA SSD, NVMe, and USB drives
- **Full read-back verification** — byte-for-byte across the whole surface for every pattern type, including random passes, which are reproduced from their AES-256-CTR seed rather than sampled. Optional per-pass verification via `--verify-each-pass`. Methods whose standard mandates verification always run it.
- **Resume capability** — auto-save state every 10 seconds, resume after interruption
- **Multi-drive parallel wipe** with live queue (add drives during active wipe)

### Live Environment
- **Bootable USB/ISO** — Alpine Linux-based live image (~200 MB) boots directly into DriveWipe TUI
- **PXE network boot** — wipe entire racks without USB drives; iPXE menu with Normal, Safe Mode, and Serial Console options
- **Custom kernel module** — direct ATA/NVMe command passthrough bypassing SCSI translation
- **HPA/DCO detection & removal** — find and remove hidden areas that software overwrites can't reach
- **Drive unfreezing** — automatic suspend/resume cycle to unfreeze ATA security-frozen drives
- **DMA I/O** — zero-copy DMA-coherent buffer I/O for maximum throughput

### Drive Health Monitoring
- **SMART data parsing** — ATA and NVMe health attributes
- **Pre/post wipe health snapshots** — automatic comparison with pass/fail verdict
- **Sequential read/write benchmarks** — performance baseline measurements
- **Temperature monitoring** — real-time temperature tracking during operations

### Drive Cloning
- **Block-level cloning** — sector-by-sector copy between drives
- **Partition-aware cloning** — resize partitions to fit target drive
- **Image I/O** — create and restore compressed, encrypted drive images
- **Compression** — flate2 and zstd support for image files
- **Encryption** — AES-256 encryption for image files

### Partition Management
- **GPT and MBR support** — full parsing and writing with CRC validation
- **Create, delete, resize, move** partitions with data preservation
- **Filesystem detection** — NTFS, ext4, FAT32, exFAT, XFS, Btrfs
- **Alignment enforcement** — 4K/1 MiB boundary alignment
- **Dry-run/preview mode** — preview changes before applying

### Forensic Analysis
- **Entropy analysis** — per-sector entropy calculation and heatmap generation
- **File signature scanning** — detect JPEG, PDF, DOCX, EXE, ZIP, and more
- **Statistical sampling** — random sector sampling with confidence levels
- **Hidden area detection** — HPA/DCO scanning (enhanced in live mode with real ATA probing)
- **Formal forensic reports** — timestamps, hash chains, chain-of-custody
- **Export formats** — DFXML, NSRL-compatible hash sets

### Drive Profiles
- **Manufacturer-specific profiles** — Samsung, WD, Seagate, Crucial, Intel, Kingston, and more
- **Automatic drive matching** — regex-based model detection
- **Optimized recommendations** — suggested wipe method per drive type
- **SLC cache and quirk awareness** — profile-driven performance tuning

### Infrastructure
- **Audit logging** — comprehensive JSONL audit trail for all operations
- **Report generation** — JSON and PDF certificate output
- **Desktop notifications** — cross-platform alerts on operation completion
- **Sleep prevention** — RAII-based system sleep inhibition during operations
- **Keyboard lock** — configurable unlock sequence prevents accidental input
- **Intelligent time estimates** — EMA-smoothed throughput with confidence intervals
- **Automated versioning** — git-commit-driven version bumps with LOC safety triggers

### One Binary, Three Interfaces
A single `drivewipe` binary contains all three interfaces and picks between them
from how you start it:

| You run | You get |
|---|---|
| `drivewipe` | Interactive terminal UI (ratatui) |
| `drivewipe --gui` | Desktop application (iced) |
| `drivewipe list`, `drivewipe wipe …` | Command line, for scripts and automation |
| `drivewipe-tui` / `drivewipe-gui` | Aliases; symlinks the installer creates |

Piping or redirecting falls back to the CLI, so `drivewipe | cat` and cron jobs
behave predictably. Server builds can omit the desktop interface entirely with
`--no-default-features --features pdf-report`.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.94+ (2024 edition)
- Root/Administrator privileges (required for raw device access)

### Build

```bash
# Build the drivewipe binary (CLI + TUI + GUI)
cargo build --release

# Headless/server build, without the desktop interface
cargo build --release --package drivewipe-cli \
  --no-default-features --features pdf-report

# Build the live USB image (requires Docker)
cargo xtask live-build
```

### Install

One command on Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KodyDennon/DriveWipe/main/install.sh | sh
```

It detects your platform, downloads the matching release, **verifies it against
the published SHA-256 checksum**, installs to `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin`
without root), and adds a desktop entry. To remove it again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KodyDennon/DriveWipe/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

Other options: `--version X.Y.Z` to pin a version, `--prefix DIR` to choose where
it goes.

Prefer to do it by hand? Download an archive from the [Releases](https://github.com/KodyDennon/DriveWipe/releases)
page — **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**, x86_64 and ARM64 — and run the
bundled `install.sh`, or just put the `drivewipe` binary on your `PATH`.

*Note: DriveWipe needs **Administrator / root** privileges to reach raw disks,
though not to install.*

To build from source:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/drivewipe-cli
```

### DriveWipe Secure Methods

The DriveWipe Secure methods combine software overwrite with firmware commands for maximum assurance:

- **HDD**: Multi-pass pattern writes followed by full verification
- **SATA SSD**: Overwrite + TRIM + overwrite + ATA Secure Erase (if available) + verify
- **NVMe**: Overwrite + deallocate + NVMe Format/Sanitize (if available) + overwrite + verify
- **USB**: Multi-pass overwrite + verify (limited by USB controller capabilities)

## Live Environment

### USB Boot

```bash
# Build the live image
cargo xtask live-build

# Write to USB (replace VERSION and /dev/sdX with your version and device)
sudo dd if=drivewipe-live-VERSION.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

### PXE Network Boot

DriveWipe Live can be network-booted for wiping entire racks. The PXE artifact (`drivewipe-live-VERSION-pxe.tar.gz`) contains everything needed to seed a TFTP/HTTP server.

```bash
# Extract PXE artifacts from a built image
tar -xzvf drivewipe-live-VERSION-pxe.tar.gz -C /var/lib/tftpboot/

# Configure dnsmasq with the included config
sudo cp /var/lib/tftpboot/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.d/drivewipe.conf
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

See [`live/pxe/README.md`](live/pxe/README.md) for full PXE setup instructions and QEMU testing.

### Live TUI Features

When running in the live environment, the TUI adds:

- **Live Dashboard** — system overview with kernel module status, CPU/RAM, drive summary
- **HPA/DCO Manager** — detect, remove HPA, restore DCO, freeze DCO with confirmation for destructive actions
- **ATA Security Manager** — view frozen/locked/enabled state, one-click unfreeze via suspend/resume
- **Kernel Module Status** — module version, capabilities bitmask, feature availability

---

## Configuration

Default config location: `~/.config/drivewipe/config.toml`

```toml
default_method = "dod-short"
parallel_drives = 2
auto_verify = true
verify_each_pass = false
remove_hidden_areas = true
auto_report_json = true
log_level = "info"
operator_name = "John Doe"
state_save_interval_secs = 10
notifications_enabled = true
sleep_prevention_enabled = true
auto_health_pre_wipe = true
keyboard_lock_sequence = "unlock"
profiles_dir = "~/.config/drivewipe/profiles"
audit_dir = "~/.local/share/drivewipe/audit"
performance_history_dir = "~/.local/share/drivewipe/performance"

[[custom_methods]]
id = "my-method"
name = "My Custom Method"
description = "Custom 2-pass wipe"
verify_after = true

[[custom_methods.passes]]
pattern_type = "random"

[[custom_methods.passes]]
pattern_type = "zero"
```

## Safety

DriveWipe includes multiple safety mechanisms:

1.  **Boot drive detection** — refuses to wipe the drive the OS is running from
2.  **Multi-step confirmation** — shows drive details, requires typing device path, 3-second countdown
3.  **SSD software wipe warning** — recommends firmware erase for SSDs (wear leveling makes software overwrite unreliable)
4.  **USB bridge warning** — firmware commands may fail through USB adapters
5.  **ATA frozen warning** — detects frozen security state, suggests suspend/resume (automatic in live mode)
6.  **HPA/DCO detection** — warns about hidden areas unreachable by software overwrite; live mode can remove them
7.  **Ctrl+C handling** — graceful interruption with state save for resume
8.  **Keyboard lock mode** — prevents accidental keystrokes during operations
9.  **Sleep prevention** — keeps system awake during long operations
10. **Pre-wipe health check** — optional automatic SMART check before wiping

## Development

### Automated Versioning

DriveWipe uses a **"Safety First"** automated versioning system. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for details.

All six crates (`drivewipe-core`, `drivewipe-cli`, `drivewipe-tui`, `drivewipe-gui`, `drivewipe-live`, `xtask`) are versioned independently based on scoped commit messages and LOC thresholds.

### xtask Commands

```bash
cargo xtask bump          # Automated version bumps based on git history
cargo xtask release       # Interactive release wizard
cargo xtask live-build    # Build the live USB image
DRIVEWIPE_LIVE_VERSION=1.1.2 ./scripts/build-live.sh
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run with verbose output
cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture

# Run live crate tests
cargo test -p drivewipe-live

# Run specific test suite
cargo test -p drivewipe-core --test integration_tests
```
